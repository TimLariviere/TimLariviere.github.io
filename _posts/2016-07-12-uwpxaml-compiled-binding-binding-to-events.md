Coming with Windows 10 are a lot of new features especially for XAML when creating a Universal Windows Platform application aka. UWP app. We can mention a few of them: new controls (as the RelativePanel, the SplitView and more); new tools for building responsive and adaptive UI (AdaptiveTrigger, Extension SDKs, etc.); and a new way to bind data to the UI, Compiled Binding.

The original post will explain you how to use the new feature allowed by x:Bind : Binding to events You can find it at this address : [https://mcnextpost.com/2015/11/10/uwpxaml-compiled-binding-binding-to-events/](https://mcnextpost.com/2015/11/10/uwpxaml-compiled-binding-binding-to-events/)
