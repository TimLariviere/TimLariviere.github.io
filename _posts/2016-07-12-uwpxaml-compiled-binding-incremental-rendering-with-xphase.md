Coming with Windows 10 are a lot of new features especially for XAML when creating a Universal Windows Platform application aka. UWP app. We can mention a few of them: new controls (as the RelativePanel, the SplitView and more); new tools for building responsive and adaptive UI (AdaptiveTrigger, Extension SDKs, etc.); and a new way to bind data to the UI, Compiled Binding.

Enhancing performances and reducing UI slugglishness with incremental rendering and x:Bind, that's what the original post is about.
