Coming with Windows 10 are a lot of new features especially for XAML when creating a Universal Windows Platform application aka. UWP app. We can mention a few of them: new controls (as the RelativePanel, the SplitView and more); new tools for building responsive and adaptive UI (AdaptiveTrigger, Extension SDKs, etc.); and a new way to bind data to the UI, Compiled Binding.

You can find the original post on how to use Compiled Binding with data in many use cases and what are the common pitfalls that you may encounter with x:Bind here : [https://mcnextpost.com/2015/11/10/uwpxaml-compiled-binding-binding-to-data/](https://mcnextpost.com/2015/11/10/uwpxaml-compiled-binding-binding-to-data/)
